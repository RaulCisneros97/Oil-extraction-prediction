# Oil-extraction-prediction
Machine learning model used to predict areas with highest oil extraction rates for invest
Datasets with historical data of oil extracted for three different areas
Scikitlearn module used for build and train model (Regression) to predict amount of oil to be extracted
Project target is to define which is the most profitable area, based on our prediction, to invest in the future
